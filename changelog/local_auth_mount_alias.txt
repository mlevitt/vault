```release-note:feature
**Local Auth Mount Entities (enterprise)**: Logins on `local` auth mounts will
generate identity entities for the tokens issued. The aliases of the entity
resulting from local auth mounts (local-aliases), will be scoped by the cluster.
This means that the local-aliases will never leave the geographical boundary of
the cluster where they were issued. This is something to be mindful about for
those who have implemented local auth mounts for complying with GDPR guidelines.
